# Code Challenge 6

## Approach and Efficiency

- The approach for this linked list implementation involves iterating through the list to perform append, insert before, and insert after operations. For appending, it requires traversing the list until the end to add the new node. Inserting before or after involves iterating through the list until finding the specified value, then inserting the new node accordingly.

## Solution

- The solution involves implementing a LinkedList class with methods for appending, inserting before, and inserting after nodes. For appending, a new node is added at the end of the list by traversing it. For inserting before or after, the list is traversed until finding the specified value, then the new node is inserted accordingly.
