# Code Challenge 15

Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Binary Tree Class (BinaryTree.js):

Implement a class to represent a binary tree.
Use a recursive approach for tree traversal methods (pre-order, in-order, and post-order).
Store the root node of the tree.
Node Class (Node.js):

Implement a class to represent nodes in the binary tree.
Each node contains a value and references to its left and right children.
Binary Search Tree Class (BinarySearchTree.js):

Extend the binary tree class to create a binary search tree.
Implement methods to add nodes and check if a value exists in the tree.
Use a while loop for adding nodes to traverse the tree iteratively.
