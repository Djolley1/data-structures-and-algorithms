## Approach & Efficiency

The approach involves implementing a Stack and a Queue using a Linked List as the underlying data structure, adhering to the Single-responsibility principle. Both Stack and Queue operations like push, pop, enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty are implemented with a time complexity of O(1) due to the use of Linked List operations.
